### Reasons your application of design / patterns, i.e.
- Easy to build/develop
- Using OpenAPI to easy generate to FE help save time to code
- Create services to help reduce dependencies injection. This makes it easier for others to keep building code by adding more functionality to a new class, using yours as a parent. It is the idea that no clients should be forced to depend on properties or methods that they donâ€™t use or need.
- In Frontend: I divide them into small component for easy development and will be less likely to impact with other functions.
